# Phase 0 Audit Report

## 1. Executive Summary
Syntax & Sips currently delivers a production-grade editorial and community publishing experience built on Next.js 15 (App Router) and Supabase Postgres/Auth. The platform already exposes public storytelling surfaces (blogs, tutorials, podcasts, changelog), gated admin tooling, gamification widgets, and Supabase edge functions for newsletters and AI summarization. However, it lacks the governance, extensibility, and documentation required to evolve into the Community Platform Fusion vision that blends long-form publishing, structured Q&A, discussion spaces, and events/commerce. Phase 0 exposes the gaps and codifies priorities for an incremental roadmap.

## 2. System Inventory
### 2.1 Applications & Frontend
- **Next.js App Router** under `src/app` with feature-first routes (`/blogs`, `/tutorials`, `/videos`, `/community`, `/admin`).
- **Neo-brutalist component library** stored in `src/components`, `src/components/ui`, `src/components/magicui`, and themed via `tailwind.config.js` & `src/app/globals.css`.
- **Authentication middleware** (`src/middleware.ts`, `src/lib/supabase`) gating admin, account, and onboarding routes.
- **Client integrations** for analytics, newsletters, and gamification controls (e.g., `src/components/admin`, `src/components/auth`, `src/components/ui/NewSummarizeButton.tsx`).

### 2.2 Backend & Data
- **Supabase Postgres** schema defined through migrations under `supabase/migrations`. Key tables: `posts`, `post_tags`, `categories`, `tags`, `profiles`, `roles`, `profile_roles`, `comments`, `newsletter_subscribers`, `site_settings`.
- **Supabase Functions** for newsletter opt-in/out and AI summarization inside `supabase/functions`.
- **Next.js API routes** within `src/app/api/**` handling CRUD for content, newsletter, gamification, and admin workflows.
- **Edge/Server components** performing server-side Supabase queries with caching hints and streaming responses.

### 2.3 Tooling & Operations
- **Testing:** Vitest configuration (`vitest.config.ts`) and Playwright setup (`playwright.config.ts`, `tests/` directory) with partial coverage.
- **Linting & formatting:** ESLint (`eslint.config.mjs`), Tailwind/PostCSS configs, but no documented Prettier hook.
- **Scripts:** `scripts/` folder for build-time helpers (e.g., chunk sync) and deployment automation.
- **Observability:** No unified telemetry spec; ad-hoc logging via console. No dashboards or metric definitions in repo.

### 2.4 Documentation
- Extensive marketing and program documentation in `/docs`, but missing the mandated artifacts for architecture, backlog, release plan, security posture, observability, and risk tracking.

## 3. Current Data Flows
| Flow | Trigger | Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Public content render | Anonymous visitor requests `/blogs/[slug]` | Next.js server component fetches from Supabase `posts` and `post_tags` tables, caches response per ISR settings | No feature flags; all users share same experience |
| Admin moderation | Authenticated admin visits `/admin` | Middleware validates Supabase session → client components fetch analytics/queues via API routes → updates persisted via Supabase | Audit logging limited to Supabase defaults |
| Newsletter opt-in | Visitor submits email form | API route validates input → Supabase function handles subscription + transactional email via Mailtrap | Limited error handling surfaced to UI |
| Gamified summarization | Reader clicks summarize button | Client component calls Supabase function / edge worker to generate summary | No usage caps; potential abuse risk |

## 4. Dependencies & Integrations
- **Supabase services:** Auth, Postgres, Edge Functions, Storage (for media assets referenced in content components).
- **Mailtrap SMTP:** For newsletter confirmations (per README environment requirements).
- **Analytics:** References to dashboards in admin components but no documented provider (likely Supabase or bespoke). Needs confirmation.
- **Third-party assets:** Tabler icon CDN in README, fonts under `/fonts`.

## 5. Known Gaps & Technical Debt (Prioritized)
| Priority | Gap / Debt | Impact | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | Missing governance documents & feature flag framework for new modules | Blocks compliant delivery of new capabilities | Produce documentation suite (this Phase 0), define flag utilities, integrate with release plan |
| P0 | No dedicated spaces/communities domain model | Prevents Spaces rollout | Design new schema (`spaces`, `space_members`, `space_rules`, `space_roles`) and APIs with feature flags |
| P0 | Observability & KPI metrics undefined | Cannot monitor KPIs or enforce SLOs | Establish telemetry spec (metrics, traces, logging) and dashboards before Phase 1 |
| P1 | Moderation tooling lacks audit logs & sanctions | Non-compliant with safety requirements | Introduce `audit_logs`, sanctions workflow, and mod action logging |
| P1 | Search experience limited to curated content pages | Does not meet taxonomy/search goals | Implement full-text search index, synonyms, and topic pages |
| P2 | Payments, donations, events, and bounties absent | Blocks monetization phases | Plan integrations (Stripe/Razorpay/UPI) with compliance and KYC flows |
| P2 | Reputation system incomplete | Privilege ladder not enforceable | Model `reputation_events`, scoring rules, and privilege gating |
| P3 | Accessibility baseline unverified | Risk of WCAG non-compliance | Add automated accessibility tests, manual audits, and design token checks |

## 6. Risks & Constraints
- **Data Integrity:** Existing schema may lack foreign keys/indices for new relationships; migrations must be reversible.
- **AuthZ Complexity:** Role expansion (member → admin) will require new policy definitions in Supabase; current RLS coverage unknown.
- **Operational Load:** Supabase quotas and email providers need capacity review before launching events/donations.
- **Timeline Pressure:** Deliverables span product, engineering, and UX; cross-functional syncs required to avoid drift.

## 7. Baseline Metrics & Gaps
- **Content publish latency:** No measurement instrumentation; must be added in Phase 1.
- **Search P95 latency:** Search not centralized; baseline currently uninstrumented pending unified search rollout.
- **Donation success rate:** Payments not implemented; baseline 0%.
- **Moderation queue age:** Admin views exist but no metric tracking; instrumentation required.
- **Event RSVP conversion:** Events not yet live.

## 8. Recommendations for Phase 1 Kickoff
1. Adopt the documentation suite defined in this repo (target architecture, product spec, roadmap, backlog, release plan).
2. Stand up feature flag utilities (likely using Supabase `site_settings` or ConfigCat/LaunchDarkly) to gate new modules.
3. Define telemetry plan before building new features to avoid retrofitting instrumentation.
4. Align design system updates with forthcoming Spaces/Content templates to reduce rework.
5. Audit Supabase RLS policies and plan for expanded role matrix.
