# Product Specification – Community Platform Fusion

## 1. Vision & Goals
Deliver a unified community platform that fuses long-form publishing, structured Q&A, discussions, events/workshops, and funding mechanics. The platform must:
- Empower creators and spaces to run end-to-end programs (content, community, commerce) within one workflow.
- Provide guardrails for moderators and admins through reputation, audit trails, and sanctions.
- Scale globally with accessibility, internationalization, and observability baked in.
- Ship iteratively with feature flags that allow opt-in enablement per space.

## 2. Personas
| Persona | Goals | Pain Points Today |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Reader/Member** | Discover high-quality content, join spaces, attend events, support creators. | Fragmented navigation across blogs vs. community; no personalization or subscriptions. |
| **Contributor/Creator** | Publish articles, answer questions, host events, monetize expertise. | Limited content types, no drafts/scheduling, no funding tools. |
| **Organizer/Moderator** | Enforce rules, curate tags, manage spaces, approve events. | No audit logs, limited rule enforcement, manual communications. |
| **Admin** | Govern the platform, configure feature flags, monitor KPIs, handle escalations. | Lack of observability, inconsistent permissioning, no consolidated release plan. |
| **Sponsor/Donor** | Fund bounties, donate to spaces/projects, track impact. | No payment rails or transparency on fees/results. |

## 9. Release Constraints
- Each module gated behind dedicated feature flags documented in `/docs/10-release-plan.md`.
- Reversible migrations with backfill scripts (Supabase SQL + worker jobs).
- Comprehensive test coverage per `/docs/09-test-strategy.md` before enabling flags.
- Staged rollout: internal staff → pilot spaces → GA.

## 10. Open Questions (Tracked in `/docs/assumptions.md`)
- Preferred feature flag service (Supabase table vs. third-party)?
- Final payment processor availability by geography?
