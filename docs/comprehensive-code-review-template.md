## 3. Instructions for Generating Actionable Tasks

Based on the code review results, the AI should automatically generate detailed tasks using this structure:

### Task Generation Logic

```
Based on your code review findings, generate detailed tasks for each issue found using the following structure:

For each issue identified:
1. **Task Title**: Clear, actionable description
2. **Category**: Security/Performance/Code Quality/etc.
3. **Severity**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
4. **File Location**: Specific file and line number
5. **Problem Description**: Detailed explanation of the issue
6. **Solution Approach**: Step-by-step fix instructions
7. **Code Changes**: Before/After code examples
8. **Testing Requirements**: What tests need to be added/modified
9. **Dependencies**: Other tasks or components this depends on
10. **Estimated Effort**: Time estimation for completion
11. **Owner Suggestion**: Recommended role/person
12. **Priority Level**: Immediate/Short-term/Medium-term/Long-term

### Task Template Example

```
### Task: Fix SQL Injection Vulnerability in User Authentication

**Category**: Security  
**Severity**: Critical  
**File Location**: `src/auth/userService.js:45-52`  
**Priority Level**: Immediate  

#### Problem Description
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks in the user authentication function. User input is directly concatenated into SQL queries without proper sanitization, allowing malicious users to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

#### Current Code
```
const query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "' AND password = '" + password + "'";
```

#### Solution Approach
1. Replace string concatenation with parameterized queries
2. Implement input validation
3. Add proper error handling
4. Update related unit tests

#### Fixed Code
```
const query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?";
const values = [username, password];
connection.query(query, values, (error, results) => {
  // Handle results
});
```

#### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Add unit test for SQL injection prevention
- [ ] Add integration test for authentication flow
- [ ] Add security test for injection attempts

#### Dependencies
- Database connection pool must support parameterized queries

#### Estimated Effort
- Development: 2 hours
- Testing: 1 hour
- Code Review: 30 minutes

#### Owner Suggestion
- Backend Developer with security experience
```

Generate tasks for ALL issues found in the code review, organized by priority level and category.
