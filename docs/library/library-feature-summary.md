## 🗄️ Database Architecture

### Tables Overview

| Table | Purpose | Key Relationships |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| `user_lists` | Store user-created lists | → profiles |
| `list_items` | Items within lists | → user_lists, posts |
| `saved_lists` | Lists saved from others | → profiles, user_lists |
| `highlights` | Text highlights | → profiles, posts |
| `reading_history` | Reading activity tracking | → profiles, posts |
| `bookmarks` | Quick save functionality | → profiles, posts |

### Key Indexes
- `user_lists_profile_id_idx` - Fast user list lookups
- `list_items_list_id_idx` - Efficient list item queries
- `highlights_profile_post_idx` - Quick highlight retrieval
- `reading_history_profile_idx` - Reading history queries
- `bookmarks_profile_post_idx` - Bookmark lookups

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All tables will have RLS policies ensuring:
- Users can only access their own private data
- Public lists are viewable by all authenticated users
- Reading history is strictly private
- Highlights can be optionally shared
