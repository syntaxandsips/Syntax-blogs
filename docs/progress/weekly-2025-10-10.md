# Weekly Progress â€” 2025-10-10

## Highlights
- Delivered GOV-000 feature flag governance slice behind Supabase tables with audit logging and typed SDK.
- Shipped admin console Feature Flag Manager experience with accessible toggles, owner fields, and inline audit cues.
- Instrumented `flag_evaluation_latency_ms` metrics pipeline and added Vitest coverage for SDK caching + invalidation.

## Feature Flags
- `spaces_v1`: OFF (governed via new manager).
- `content_templates_v1`: OFF.
- `search_unified_v1`: OFF.
- `reputation_v1`: OFF.
- `moderation_automation_v1`: OFF.
- `donations_v1`: OFF.
- `payouts_v1`: OFF.
- `events_v1`: OFF.
- `messaging_v1`: OFF.
- `notifications_v1`: OFF.

## Metrics Snapshot
- `flag_evaluation_latency_ms` (p50/p95): 3.1ms / 4.7ms (dev instrumentation via console adapter).
- No authz denials generated by feature flag endpoints in dev smoke tests.

## Risks / Follow-ups
- Need to extend test harness for admin API routes once Supabase test fixtures are ready (tracks into GOV-000 subtasks).
- Playwright admin journey pending for accessibility scan of Feature Flag Manager.
- Coordinate with OBS-100 to pipe histogram metrics into OTEL exporter.
