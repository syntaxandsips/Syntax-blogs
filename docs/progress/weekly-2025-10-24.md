# Weekly Progress — 2025-10-24

## Shipped Tickets
- SEC-001: RBAC/RLS hardening (Role Manager UI, policy migrations, guard telemetry) behind `rbac_hardening_v1`.
- UX-010: Navigation IA & design tokens applied to top nav and admin role tooling behind `nav_ia_v1`.
- OBS-100: Observability baseline instrumentation (nav interaction metrics, synthetic journeys, structured logging enrichments) behind `observability_v1` UI surfaces.

## Flags Enabled
- `rbac_hardening_v1`: Staff-only in staging for Role Manager validation.
- `nav_ia_v1`: Staff-only cohort to evaluate hub engagement.
- `observability_v1`: SRE sandbox only; dashboards linked but UI gates remain off for general users.

## KPI Deltas
- `authz_denied_count` trending flat (≤2/min) after Role Manager smoke tests.
- `nav_interaction_total` baseline captured for staff navigation (~35 clicks/hour) to tune IA.
- `content_publish_latency_ms` P95 steady at 4.2s post-instrumentation.

## New Risks / Assumptions
- A-009: Flag ownership clarified (Design Lead for nav IA, SRE Lead for observability); update kept open for Phase-1 tracking.
- Monitoring gap: Playwright synthetic suite depends on `PLAYWRIGHT_TEST_BASE_URL`; missing env will skip checks—documented for CI configuration.

## Next Targets
- Harden Storybook coverage for tokenized components (SpaceHeader, TemplatePickerModal, DonationWidget, EventCard).
- Expand RLS integration tests to cover reports/audit log mutations with moderator/admin roles.
- Connect dashboards to production Grafana workspace and validate alert routing (`pd-sec-ops`, `ops-telemetry`).
