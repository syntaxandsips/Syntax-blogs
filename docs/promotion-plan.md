# Syntax & Sips Promotion Plan

Launching Syntax & Sips as an open collaboration hub requires intentional outreach. This plan captures the channels, messaging, and cadence we will use to attract early contributors.

## Objectives

1. Announce public availability of the repository and invite code contributions.
2. Highlight differentiatorsâ€”AI-assisted editorial tooling, Supabase integration, and the neobrutalist design system.
3. Grow a sustainable contributor base that can participate in roadmap discussions and issue triage.

## Key Messages

- Syntax & Sips delivers a full-stack editorial platform for AI and deep-tech storytellers.
- The project is community-curated with strict quality standards, automated testing, and transparent governance.
- Contributors gain experience with Next.js 15, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, and gamified community mechanics.

## Launch Checklist

- [ ] Publish a blog post on syntax-blogs.prashant.sbs summarizing the platform and linking to GitHub.
- [ ] Share the announcement on LinkedIn, X, and relevant Discord/Slack communities.
- [ ] Submit the project to curated lists such as Awesome Open Source, Open Source Builders, and Dev.to.
- [ ] Coordinate with Supabase and Next.js community spotlights for potential amplification.
- [ ] Host a live stream or recorded walkthrough covering setup, architecture, and contribution workflows.

## Sustained Engagement

- Maintain a monthly changelog newsletter featuring merged contributions and upcoming focus areas.
- Run quarterly community calls to review roadmap milestones and gather feedback.
- Tag issues with `good first issue` and `help wanted` labels and promote them on social channels.
- Encourage contributors to write tutorials or case studies and feature them in the docs hub.

## Metrics to Monitor

- Issue/PR volume and first-response time.
- New contributors per quarter and their retention rate.

Keep this plan updated as channels evolve and new opportunities emerge.
