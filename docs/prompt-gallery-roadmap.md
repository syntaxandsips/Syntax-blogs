### 4.4 Security & Performance

#### 4.4.1 Security Measures
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens using Supabase Auth helpers.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) with Supabase Row Level Security policies.
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas for all API inputs and responses with shared typing between frontend and backend.
- **Content Moderation**:
  - Automated NSFW detection via edge function before assets are published.
  - Profanity filtering and banned keyword checks for prompt text.
  - Duplicate detection based on embeddings and shingled hashes.
  - Rate limiting per user/IP for uploads, comments, and votes.
- **File Security**:
  - Virus scanning for uploads.
  - File type and size restrictions enforced server-side.
  - Signed URLs with expiration for asset access.
- **Privacy**: GDPR/CCPA compliance with data deletion workflows, audit trails, and consent logging.

#### 4.4.2 Performance Optimization
- **Caching Strategy**:
  - Redis/Upstash for frequent queries (filters, trending prompts).
  - CDN (Vercel Edge + Supabase Storage) for static assets.
  - Edge caching for popular prompts and featured collections.
- **Database Optimization**:
  - Proper indexing for filters and searches (GIN indexes, pgvector indexes).
  - Query optimization with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` review and materialized views for leaderboard stats.
  - Connection pooling via Supabase serverless functions.
- **Frontend Optimization**:
  - Lazy loading for images and off-screen content.
  - Code splitting and React Server Components for initial payload reduction.
  - Service worker for offline bookmarking and copy history.
  - Image optimization with AVIF/WebP and responsive sizes.
- **Monitoring**:
  - Performance metrics tracking (Core Web Vitals, prompt interaction funnel).
  - Error monitoring with Sentry or Vercel Observability.
  - Uptime monitoring with alerts for API and Supabase services.
