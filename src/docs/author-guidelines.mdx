# Community Author Guidelines

Welcome to the Syntax & Sips contributor guild! To keep our digital brew flavorful and trustworthy, please follow these guardrails:

## Craft with Clarity
- Lead with a strong POV rooted in hands-on experience.
- Provide accurate citations, benchmarks, or repos for technical claims.
- Write for curious practitioners—explain acronyms, avoid jargon when a plain phrase works.

## Accessibility & Inclusion
- Use descriptive headings, alt text, and semantic markdown.
- Prefer gender-neutral language; highlight diverse voices and global perspectives.

## Editorial Quality
- Keep summaries between 160-220 characters.
- Aim for 1,200–2,000 words per story unless it’s a tutorial or deep dive.
- Include actionable next steps, code snippets, diagrams, or demos when helpful.

## Responsible AI Disclosures
- Call out AI-assisted sections, tooling, and model versions.
- Never paste private or third-party code without permission.

## Collaboration Rituals
- Respond to reviewer feedback within 3 business days.
- Surface blockers via the notes-to-editors panel in the workspace.
- Respect revision requests—even published posts can be updated for accuracy.
