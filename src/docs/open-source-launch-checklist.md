# Open Source Launch Checklist

Setting your project up for community contributions requires more than flipping the visibility toggle. This guide captures the essential steps and supporting rationale so maintainers can confidently invite collaborators without compromising legal clarity or project health.

## 1. Choose an Open Source License

**Why it matters:** Licensing is what converts a personal codebase into a legally consumable open source project. Without it, potential contributors have no formal right to use, modify, or distribute your work.

**How to do it:**

1. Pick a license that matches your goals—MIT for maximum reuse, Apache 2.0 for patent protections, GPLv3 for copyleft requirements, or a custom community-source license if you require explicit permission for derivative or commercial use.
2. When creating a new GitHub repository, select a license through the setup UI so GitHub seeds a `LICENSE` file automatically.
3. For existing repositories, add the full license text manually in a `LICENSE` file at the root of the repo.
4. Link to [GitHub's licensing guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository) for future reference.

> [!TIP]
> Always commit the license alongside your initial public release so there is a clear provenance for downstream users.

## 2. Draft a README That Welcomes Contributors

**Why it matters:** The README is the landing page for your project. It orients newcomers, explains the problem you are solving, and highlights the value of getting involved.

**Include these building blocks:**

- **Project purpose:** A succinct introduction to what the project does and why it exists.
- **Key features or use cases:** Help readers envision success quickly.
- **Getting started instructions:** Installation, configuration, and usage steps that someone can follow in a single session.
- **Contribution pathways:** Reference your contributing guide so readers know how to help.
- **Support channels:** Point to discussions, issue templates, or community chat servers for troubleshooting.
- **License callout:** Reinforce the license you selected and any attribution requirements.

**Implementation tips:**

1. Create a `README.md` in the repository root so GitHub renders it automatically.
2. Lean on established templates such as [Make a README](https://www.makeareadme.com/) or [PurpleBooth's README template](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2) to jumpstart structure.
3. Keep tone friendly but focused—make it obvious where contributors should click next.

## 3. Publish Contributing Guidelines

**Why it matters:** A `CONTRIBUTING.md` acts as your project's onboarding manual. It sets expectations, reduces triage churn, and gives contributors confidence that their effort will align with maintainer standards.

**Outline the essentials:**

- How to file bug reports and feature requests (link to issue templates if available).
- Steps to set up the development environment locally.
- Coding, formatting, and testing conventions.
- Pull request expectations (branch naming, review cadence, CI requirements).
- A roadmap or backlog snapshot to spotlight priority areas.

**Implementation tips:**

1. Store `CONTRIBUTING.md` at the root level so GitHub highlights it when users open issues or PRs.
2. Update it whenever workflows shift—stale guidance can be worse than none.
3. Reference high-quality templates such as [Nayafia's contributing guide](https://github.com/nayafia/contributing-template) or [Mozilla's working open playbook](https://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/contributing_guidelines/).

## 4. Adopt a Code of Conduct

**Why it matters:** Inclusive community guidelines signal that you value respectful collaboration and have a plan for handling conflicts.

**Implementation tips:**

1. Adapt a proven framework like the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) into `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` in your repository root.
2. Mention enforcement contacts and escalation paths so people know where to turn.
3. Cross-link the code of conduct from both the README and CONTRIBUTING guide to keep expectations visible.

## 5. Confirm Repository Visibility

**Why it matters:** Contributions can only flow if the repository is public.

**Checklist:**

1. Visit **Settings → General → Change repository visibility** inside GitHub.
2. Switch to **Public** and confirm you are comfortable with the history you are exposing.
3. Review branch protection rules and CI status checks before inviting contributors.

## 6. Configure Optional GitHub Conveniences

Layering automation accelerates onboarding and keeps contributions consistent.

- **Issue templates (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`)** guide reporters to provide actionable details.
- **Pull request templates (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE`)** remind contributors to document testing.
- **Project boards** visualize roadmap items and help maintainers triage incoming work.
- **Labels and milestones** make it easier to filter issues and communicate timelines.

## 7. Promote the Project

Even a well-documented repository needs visibility.

- Share the launch on social channels, newsletters, or forums where your target contributors gather.
- Add descriptive topics/tags on GitHub so it surfaces in search.
- Engage with early contributors quickly—responsiveness builds trust.

## Launch-Ready Checklist

Use this quick scan before flipping the switch:

- [ ] `LICENSE` committed with a clear, appropriate open source license.
- [ ] `README.md` updated with purpose, getting started, contribution paths, and support references.
- [ ] `CONTRIBUTING.md` covering issues, setup, standards, and pull request rituals.
- [ ] `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` published and linked throughout documentation.
- [ ] Repository visibility confirmed as **Public** (or scheduled for the launch date).
- [ ] Optional GitHub templates/boards configured to streamline contributions.
- [ ] Promotion plan drafted so prospective contributors hear about the project.

By following this sequence you create a legally sound, clearly documented, and welcoming foundation that encourages developers to participate with confidence.
