# Prompt Gallery

The Prompt Gallery is a community hub for sharing repeatable AI workflows. Every prompt features:

- Model metadata so you know which foundation model delivers the best results.
- Media previews and parameters for quick experimentation.
- Community stats including copies, downloads, and discussion threads.

Use the gallery filters to explore by media type, monetization policy, language, or difficulty. When you find a prompt you love, copy it directly or bookmark it to revisit later. Uploading prompts is open to every verified memberâ€”each submission goes through light moderation to keep results high quality.

> Pricing and premium features are **coming soon**. All prompts are currently free while we finalize creator payouts.

## Upload guidelines

1. Provide a clear title and description that explains the output.
2. Attach reference assets whenever possible so other creators can remix quickly.
3. Tag your prompt with media types and topics so it surfaces in search.
4. Keep the monetization type set to **free** until the pricing beta launches.
