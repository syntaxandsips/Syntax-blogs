# Build Verification Report

## Overview
- **Date:** 2025-10-07T07:16:09Z
- **Environment:** Containerized Node.js 22 runtime with npm 10.x (Next.js 15 project).

## Steps Executed
1. Installed production dependencies via `npm install` to ensure runtime packages like `nodemailer` are present.
2. Ran `npm run build` to produce the optimized Next.js output.

## Results
- Initial build attempt failed because the lockfile had not been installed in the workspace, leading to `Module not found: Can't resolve 'nodemailer'`. After installing dependencies, the build completed successfully.【6c1dde†L1-L12】【c75cca†L1-L14】
- The final build succeeded, though static generation reported transient `fetch failed` warnings when attempting to pre-render Supabase-backed pages. These originate from network access to Supabase during `generateStaticParams` and do not stop the build, but they should be monitored in environments without Supabase connectivity.【851a88†L1-L19】【02e220†L1-L13】【774d31†L1-L11】

## Follow-up Recommendations
- Ensure `npm install` (or the appropriate package manager install step) runs in CI/CD before invoking `next build`.
- Consider stubbing or guarding Supabase fetches in `generateStaticParams` to avoid noisy warnings during offline builds.
